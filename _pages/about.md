I am currently a Senior Undergrad Student major in Data Science at University of California, San Diego. I spent most of my undergrad time in the industry. However, I do have a tentative plan to do some research for my Grad School.

Research Interest
======
I don't think there would be anyone looking at this page, but I would say I am broadly interested in anything that requires programming. Will add more in the future.

Language 
======
I am quite interested in learning different languages. While I am a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese, I have professional proficiency in English. I also have 1.5 years learning experience of French and 0.5 years of Spanish.


Hobbies
======
I have a 10 year experience in Jazz Drum and 8 year experience in Korean Taekwondo.
