I am currently a Senior Undergrad Student major in Data Science at University of California, San Diego. I spent most of my undergrad time in the industry. However, I do have a tentative plan to do research for my Grad School

Research Interest

I don't think there would be anyone looking at this page, but I would say I am broadly interested in anything that requires programming. Will add more in the future.
