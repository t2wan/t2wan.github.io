Course Description
======
This course, the first of a two-course sequence (DSC 40A and DSC 40B), will introduce the theoretical foundations of data science. Students will become familiar with mathematical language for expressing data analysis problems and solution strategies, and will receive training in probabilistic reasoning, mathematical modeling of data, and algorithmic problem solving. DSC 40A will introduce fundamental topics in machine learning, statistics and linear algebra with applications to data analysis.
